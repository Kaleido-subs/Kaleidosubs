# Kaleido-subs' Subtitles

Heavily inspired by [GJM's batch scripts](https://github.com/Fyurie/gjmbatchscripts), you can find any and all of our scripts in this repository. They will be continuously updated to ensure there are as few errors as possible. We also accept pull requests.<br>

You are free to make use of these scripts for your own uses, but credit is appreciated. For encoding scripts, look [here](https://github.com/LightArrowsEXE/Encoding-Projects/tree/master/%5BKaleido-subs%5D).
